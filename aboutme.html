        <u>Introduction</u>
        <hr>
        <p>Hey, I'm Tim Stumper and I am a Junior Computer Science(BS) student at the University of Delaware. I'm from Simsbury, Connecticut if anyone here knows where that is. My
            main interests are music, skating, anime, and of course, computer science. My interest in CS started around 6th grade when my brother took a CS course in high school. 
            Ever since then I kinda knew I wanted to do something in this field and (clearly) that hasn't changed.
        </p>
        <u>Skating</u>
        <hr>
        <p>I spend a large amount of my free time skating. I get really excited to learn to tricks, talk to other skaters, and just overall have a fun time while
            getting better at skating. As funny as it may seem, skating has taught me a lot about how to overcome challenges and I've grown a lot from it. I've learned how
            to approach a problem without the fear of failure because failing teaches you what you're doing wrong. I'm always looking for new people to skate with so if you're
            interested let me know.
