        <p class="abouttitle"><u>Introduction</u></p>
        <p class="aboutinfo">Hey! I'm Tim Stumper and I am a Junior Computer Science(BS) student at the University of Delaware. I'm from Simsbury, Connecticut. My
            main interests are music, skating, anime/manga, and computer science. Feel free to talk to me about any of these things, I like meeting new people! 
            
        </p>
        <p>Fun Fact: I am a lefty</p>
        <p class="abouttitle"><u>Skating</u></p>
        <p class="aboutinfo">I spend a lot of time doing this. It's really exiting to learn to tricks, talk to other skaters, and just overall have a fun time while
            getting better at skating. As funny as it may seem, skating has taught me a lot about how to overcome challenges and I've grown a lot from it. I've learned how
            to approach a problem without the fear of failure because failing teaches you what you're doing wrong. I'm always looking for new people to skate with so if you're
            interested let me know!
