          <h3>Short Report</h3>
          <p>It's never easy to write to a whole company. You have to be aware that there are people above and below you who might not know about what you're talking about, so you must tailor your writing to as general an audience as possible. I felt much more prepared to do so upon completing this report. I was set to write a three page report on how my company of choice (Vans) should focus more on social media to promote sales and recover from the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

            <h3>Internal Messaging</h3>
            <p>Assignments like this show me that I'm not the biggest fan of writing announcements from inside a company. I didn't find it too difficult; however, I found myself stressed out while writing it as I imagined what the other employees would think of me after they read my e-mail. Nonetheless, it was good practice and taught me how to write more serious, businesswide e-mails.</p>

            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>I was tasked to write an original mission statement for an organization that meant something to me. For this, I decided to write one for CS+ Social Good, a club at my university that promotes using computer science technology in socially and environmentally healthy ways. I really learned how to analyze the values of an organization and how to summarize them into a simple mission statement.

            <h3>Identifying Persuasive Rhetoric</h3>
            <p>I really enjoyed analyzing popular rap song "Murder To Excellence" by Jay-Z and Kanye. This assignment really solidified my understanding of persuasive rhetoric and its' trifecta (pathos, logos, and ethos); as we had to find examples of all three from the lyrics. With this new understanding, I can more easily understand the tone of asks in the workplace and offer a suitable response.</p>

            <h3>Position Paper</h3>
            <p>Back in freshman year of college, I was tasked to write a paper standing for something I cared about. I wrote about how social media affects mental health with loads of research to back up my claims. I'd say this is the longest and most in depth paper I've written and it taught me a lot about how to present my thoughts and support them with credible research.</p>
